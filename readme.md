2.Document how to run the program you created in question 1 in a readme.md file in your repo. Be as clear as possible. Use proper markdown, and consider using screenshots. Be sure to briefly discuss why this kind of exercise might be helpful for NLP in your markdown.

# NLP

## Natural Language Processing (NLP) allows machines to break down and interpret human language.

### There are two main phases to natural language processing: data preprocessing and algorithm development.

## In first question i wrote down code in visual code

### Open the file in read mode


### Loop through each line of the file

### Remove the leading spaces and newline character

### Convert the characters in line to 

### lowercase to avoid case mismatch

### Remove the punctuation marks from the line

### Split the line into words

### Iterate over each word in line

### Check if the word is already in dictionary

### Print the contents of dictionary


## Businesses use large quantities of unstructured, text-heavy data and need a way to efficiently process it. A lot of the information created online and stored in databases is natural human language, and until recently, businesses could not effectively analyze this data. This is where natural language processing is useful.

## Benefits of natural language processing

### improved accuracy and efficiency of documentation;

### ability to automatically make a readable summary of a larger, more complex original text and easier to perform sentiment analysis.
